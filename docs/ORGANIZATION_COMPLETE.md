# 📚 Documentation Organization Complete!

## ✅ What Was Done

All documentation files have been organized into a `docs/` folder for better project structure.

### Files Organized
- ✅ 15+ documentation files moved to `docs/` folder
- ✅ Created `docs/INDEX.md` - Master index of all documentation
- ✅ Created `DOCS_ORGANIZATION.md` - Quick navigation guide (root level)
- ✅ Organized by category: Quick Start, Setup, Checklists, Fixes, etc.

### File Structure
```
project/
├── docs/                    ← ALL DOCUMENTATION HERE
│   ├── INDEX.md            ← START HERE
│   ├── DEPLOYMENT.md
│   ├── ARCHITECTURE.md
│   ├── CONFIG_REFERENCE.md
│   └── ... (13 more files)
│
├── frontend/
├── backend/
├── Dockerfile
├── README.md               ← Main project doc
├── DOCS_ORGANIZATION.md    ← Quick navigation (root)
└── (Other project files)
```

## 🚀 How to Use

### Option 1: Start from root
```
DOCS_ORGANIZATION.md (in root) → Links to docs/
```

### Option 2: Go directly to docs
```
docs/INDEX.md → Full documentation index
```

### Option 3: Quick reference
```
docs/DEPLOYMENT_QUICK_START.txt → Copy/paste commands
```
